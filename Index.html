       <h2 style="color: darkgreen;" ALIGN="CENTER">About Nepal</h2>
<p>Nepal is a landlocked country in South Asia, located between two giant neighbors: China in the north and India in the south, east, and west. It has a population of about 30 million people. Kathmandu is the capital city and also the largest. Nepal is famous for its beautiful mountains, green forests, rivers, and cultural heritage. It is home to eight of the world’s ten highest mountains, including Mount Everest.</p>

<p>Though Nepal is a small country, it has a great variety in geography. The northern region has cold mountains, the middle region has hills with moderate climate, and the southern Terai region is flat and warm.</p>

       <h2 style="color: #008080;" ALIGN="CENTER">Nepali Culture</h2>
<p>Nepali culture is influenced by both Indian and Tibetan traditions. It is a mix of different languages, customs, and lifestyles. There are over 120 ethnic groups and more than 100 languages spoken. Despite this diversity, people live in peace and harmony. The main language is Nepali, but many people speak their local languages too.</p>

<p>Respecting parents, teachers, and elders is an important value in Nepali society. Traditional clothing includes *daura suruwal* for men and *gunyo cholo* or *sari* for women. People also wear modern clothes, especially in cities. Most people greet others by saying “Namaste” with both palms joined together.</p>s
